                You stumble upon a lake. Both of you and the Golem it was a good time to call it a day. You did some fishing with a poorly made fishing rod, which you fashioned with a stick and a bit of rope you made with long grass. You and the golem had a nice dinner together and you slept under the starry night. Next morning you continue your quest to get this cute Golem home. Along the way, you and the Golem had many adventures ahead of you.
