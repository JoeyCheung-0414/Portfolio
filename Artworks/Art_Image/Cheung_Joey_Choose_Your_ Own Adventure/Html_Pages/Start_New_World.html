                You decide why not go to another world. You have nothing better to do in this life, why not live a new one? Why not see a new world and make new friends like in those cartoons? The skeleton opens the door that you came from. This time the location is different. You were curious about how that works but nonetheless, you did not question it.  You asked the skeleton for a drink as that was your original goal and you are going to get your drink. <br>

                “Here is the menu,” he said. <br>

                You get your drink and a snack. You finish it and go off on your own in this new world.
