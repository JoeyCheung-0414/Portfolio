                Against your better judgment from all those horror movies you watched, you knock on it anyway. You hear a few crushing noises and a couple of grunts. The door opens after a few seconds and you gaze at a witch. As soon as the small Golem saw the witch it cheered right up! “Human… Help! Golem. Home!” It said excitedly. 
                “Adventurer thank you for returning this little one. I was looking for them all over.”  The witch says. 
                The witch was grateful, and after you explained your situation she was more than happy to help. She gave you advice and some supplies for you. You were always welcome to come to her should you need any help or potions. With that, your 1st adventure out of many came to a close.
