                You say no. You have angered the witch with your decision and she has cursed you! As you went along the rest of the journey in this strange new world you were hit with an ungodly amount of bad luck. You were attacked by various monsters and when you asked others to join their party they refused. You started to think that coming to this world was a bad idea. Just as the skeleton said you were never able to find your way back to your homeworld forced to live a life filled with misfortune.
