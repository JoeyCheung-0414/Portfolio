                 You wander around in the lush area and stumble upon an old cabin. Against your better judgment from all those horror movies you watched, you knock on it anyway. You hear a few crushing noises and a couple of grunts. The door opens after a few seconds and you gaze at a witch. “Ahh perfect! You're just perfect! Dearly you must be the new helper I asked Bayanette for!” she said with enthusiasm. <br> 
                
                 You explain you are not and she responded “You're not? Well if you want to help this witch out that would be much appreciated.”
