                You gathered the correct items and the witch was pleased with your work. She offered you some snacks as you two had a nice chat. You mention that you are a new adventurer in this new world. She offered you advice and a couple of basic supplies for your efforts. Before you left she said you were always welcome to come to her should you need any potions or advice in this world. With that, you gained an ally and you set off to explore more of this new world.
